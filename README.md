# ignite-react-pomodoro

Pomodoro timer application built with TS/React as part of Rocketseat's Ignite bootcamp.

What is the Pomodoro Technique?

A time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This app helps you manage your time more effectively by providing a simple and intuitive interface to track your work and break periods.
